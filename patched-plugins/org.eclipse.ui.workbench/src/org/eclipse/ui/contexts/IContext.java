/**
 * An instance of this interface is an context as defined by the extension point
 * <code>org.eclipse.ui.contexts</code>.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this interface can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>IContextManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not an context
 * with that identifier is defined in the extension registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation. If a context is defined, that means that
 * its corresponding plug-in is active. If the plug-in is then deactivated, the
 * context will still exist but it will be undefined. An attempts to use an
 * undefined context will result in a <code>NotDefinedException</code> being
 * thrown.
 * </p>

 * This interface is not intended to be extended or implemented by clients.

 * @deprecated Please use the "org.eclipse.core.commands" plug-in instead.
