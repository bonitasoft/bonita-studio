/**
 * A workbench part is a visual component within a workbench page.  There
 * are two subtypes: view and editor, as defined by <code>IViewPart</code> and
 * <code>IEditorPart</code>.  
 * <p>
 * A view is typically used to navigate a hierarchy of information (like the 
 * workspace), open an editor, or display properties for the active editor.  
 * Modifications made in a view are saved immediately.  
 * </p><p>
 * An editor is typically used to edit or browse a document or input object. 
 * The input is identified using an <code>IEditorInput</code>.  Modifications made 
 * in an editor part follow an open-save-close lifecycle model.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface may be implemented directly.  For convenience, a base
 * implementation is defined in <code>WorkbenchPart</code>.
 * </p><p>
 * The lifecycle of a workbench part is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>When a part extension is created:
 *    <ul>
 *		<li>instantiate the part</li>
 *		<li>create a part site</li>
 *		<li>call <code>part.init(site)</code></li>
 * 	  </ul>
 *  <li>When a part becomes visible in the workbench:
 * 	  <ul> 
 *		<li>add part to presentation by calling 
 *        <code>part.createPartControl(parent)</code> to create actual widgets</li>
 *		<li>fire <code>partOpened</code> event to all listeners</li>
 *	  </ul>
 *   </li>
 *  <li>When a part is activated or gets focus:
 *    <ul>
 *		<li>call <code>part.setFocus()</code></li>
 *		<li>fire <code>partActivated</code> event to all listeners</li>
 *	  </ul>
 *   </li>
 *  <li>When a part is closed:
 *    <ul>
 *		<li>if save is needed, do save; if it fails or is canceled return</li>
 *		<li>if part is active, deactivate part</li>
 *		<li>fire <code>partClosed</code> event to all listeners</li>
 *		<li>remove part from presentation; part controls are disposed as part
 *         of the SWT widget tree
 *		<li>call <code>part.dispose()</code></li>
 *	  </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After <code>createPartControl</code> has been called, the implementor may 
 * safely reference the controls created.  When the part is closed 
 * these controls will be disposed as part of an SWT composite.  This
 * occurs before the <code>IWorkbenchPart.dispose</code> method is called.
 * If there is a need to free SWT resources the part should define a dispose 
 * listener for its own control and free those resources from the dispose
 * listener.  If the part invokes any method on the disposed SWT controls 
 * after this point an <code>SWTError</code> will be thrown.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The last method called on <code>IWorkbenchPart</code> is <code>dispose</code>.  
 * This signals the end of the part lifecycle.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An important point to note about this lifecycle is that following 
 * a call to init, createPartControl may never be called. Thus in the dispose
 * method, implementors must not assume controls were created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Workbench parts implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface; extensions
 * are managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
