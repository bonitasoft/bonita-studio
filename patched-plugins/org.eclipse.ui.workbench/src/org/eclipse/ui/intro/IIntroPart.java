/**
 * The intro part is a visual component within the workbench responsible for
 * introducing the product to new users. The intro part is typically shown the
 * first time a product is started up.
 * <p>
 * The intro part implementation is contributed to the workbench via the
 * <code>org.eclipse.ui.intro</code> extension point.  There can be several
 * intro part implementations, and associations between intro part
 * implementations and products. The workbench will only make use of the intro
 * part implementation for the current product (as given by
 * {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform#getProduct()}. There is at most one
 * intro part instance in the entire workbench, and it resides in exactly one
 * workbench window at a time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface in not intended to be directly implemented. Rather, clients
 * providing a intro part implementation should subclass 
 * {@link org.eclipse.ui.part.IntroPart}.
