 * An <code>IIdentifier</code> is an object that offers an easy means to 
 * determine if a given string matches the pattern bindings of any IActivity 
 * objects.  Additionaly, one may query if an identifier is enabled.  An 
 * identifier is always considered enabled unless it matches only disabled activities.
