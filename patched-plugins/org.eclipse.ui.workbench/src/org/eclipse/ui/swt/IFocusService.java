/**
 * Tracks focusGained and focusLost events for a Control registered with this
 * service, and provides the control and its registered ID as variables to the
 * application evaluation context for evaluation by the various services.
 * <p>
 * This service provides 2 variables, activeFocusControl (a Control) and
 * activeFocusControlId (the ID registered with the service).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use this service to provide default cut/copy/paste/selectAll for
 * specific text controls outside of the normal workbench part lifecycle, like a
 * control contributed to the trim. For example:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;handler
 *      class=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.WidgetMethodHandler:paste&quot;
 *      commandId=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.edit.paste&quot;&gt;
 *   &lt;activeWhen&gt;
 *      &lt;with variable=&quot;activeFocusControlId&quot;&gt;
 *         &lt;equals value=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.tests.focusText&quot;/&gt;
 *      &lt;/with&gt;
 *   &lt;/activeWhen&gt;
 * &lt;/handler&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This service can be acquired from your service locator:
 * <pre>
 * 	IFocusService service = (IFocusService) getSite().getService(IFocusService.class);
 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This service is available globally.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
