/**
 * A editor action bar contributor defines the actions for one or more editors.
 * <p>
 * Within the workbench there may be more than one open editor of a particular
 * type. For instance, there may be 1 or more open Java Editors. To avoid the
 * creation of duplicate actions and action images the editor concept has been
 * split into two. An action contributor is responsible for the creation of
 * actions. The editor is responsible for action implementation. Furthermore,
 * the contributor is shared by each open editor. As a result of this design
 * there is only 1 set of actions for 1 or more open editors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The relationship between editor and contributor is defined by the
 * <code>org.eclipse.ui.editors</code> extension point in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface should not be implemented directly. An implementation of this
 * interface has been created in <code>EditorActionBarContributor</code>.
 * Implementors should subclass this and specialize as required.
