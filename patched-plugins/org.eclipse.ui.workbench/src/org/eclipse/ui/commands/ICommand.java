 * An instance of <code>ICommand</code> is a handle representing a command as
 * defined by the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.commands</code>. The
 * identifier of the handle is identifier of the command being represented.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>ICommand</code> can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>ICommandManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not a command
 * with that identifier defined in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation. If a command is defined, that means that
 * its corresponding plug-in is active. If the plug-in is then deactivated, the
 * command will still exist but it will be undefined. An attempts to use an
 * undefined command will result in a <code>NotDefinedException</code> being
 * thrown.
