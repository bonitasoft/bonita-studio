/**
 * <p>
 * A category is a grouping of commands by functional area. For example, in the
 * Eclipse workbench, "Text Editing" is a category containing various commands
 * related to text editing. A category's primary functionality is to control the
 * display of commands to the user. When appropriate, commands displayed to the
 * user (e.g., keys preference page) will be grouped by category.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>ICategory</code> is a handle representing a category
 * as defined by the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.commands</code>.
 * The identifier of the handle is identifier of the category being represented.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>ICategory</code> can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>ICommandManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not a category
 * with that identifier defined in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation, which causes dynamic changes to the
 * plugin registry, and therefore, potentially, dynamic changes to the set of
 * category definitions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be extended or implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @since 3.0
 * @see ICategoryListener

 * @deprecated Please use the "org.eclipse.core.commands" plug-in instead.
