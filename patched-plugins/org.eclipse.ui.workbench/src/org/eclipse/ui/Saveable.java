 * A <code>Saveable</code> represents a unit of saveability, e.g. an editable
 * subset of the underlying domain model that may contain unsaved changes.
 * Different workbench parts (editors and views) may present the same saveables
 * in different ways. This interface allows the workbench to provide more
 * appropriate handling of operations such as saving and closing workbench
 * parts. For example, if two editors sharing the same saveable with unsaved
 * changes are closed simultaneously, the user is only prompted to save the
 * changes once for the shared saveable, rather than once for each editor.
 * <p>
 * Workbench parts that work in terms of saveables should implement
