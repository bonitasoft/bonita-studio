Classes for actions and operations used in a workbench
window, page, or part in the Eclipse Platform User Interface.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
Actions for resource management, project build and workbench page management
are provided to encourage a standard look and feel across views and editors
contributed by independent system vendors. Base classes are also provided
for selection oriented actions which enable or disable based upon selection
in a part or viewer. These should be used by ISV's to define actions for
menus, toolbars, and context menus.
<p>Action which leads to resource modification should take advantage of
the <tt>WorkspaceModifyOperation</tt> classes.&nbsp; These classes are
used to defer events which typically occur as a result of workspace changes
(such as the firing of resource deltas, performance of autobuilds, etc.)
until the outermost operation has successfully completed.&nbsp; This deferral
leads to an optimized, faster execution of resource modification because
fewer deltas and autobuilds are performed.
