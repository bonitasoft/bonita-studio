<p>A condition on a transition is evaluated by the Bonita Execution Engine to determine whether the transition path is taken or not taken. Transition conditions can be defined using a decision table. In the table, a series of rows are defined, each of which is evaluated to apply a take or don't take decision.</p>

<p>It is possible to have multiple conditions. Each condition has its own row.</p>

<p>Each row in the table decision defines a condition where variables are compared. If the condition is met (that is, evaluated to "true"), the indicated decision will be taken. If it is evaluated to "false", the next row in the table will be evaluated. If its condition is met, its indicated decision will be taken.</p>

<p>The first row in the decision table to meet its condition will "make" the decision.  The transition will be taken (or not taken) according to the Decision and the action is completed.</p>

<p>If none of the conditions in the rows in the decision table are met, then the default decision will be taken.</p>
