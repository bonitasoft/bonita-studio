contractSectionDescription=Define a contract for this step or pool instantiation.
processContractSectionDescription=A contract defines the information that a process requires for instantiation.\nAfter you have defined the contract, you can generate the form by clicking the UI designer icon on the right of this panel. This generates a form with the relevant widgets and data bindings for the process instantiation inputs. You must handle constraints with validation in the form.\nYou can use contract input values as the initial value of variables, documents and search keys or in connectors in (on enter).
stepContractSectionDescription=A contract defines the information that a task requires to execute. If inputs are missing or constraints are not fulfilled on form submission, the task is not executed and stays ready.\nAfter you have defined the contract, you can generate the form by clicking the UI designer icon on the right of this panel. This generates a form with the relevant widgets and data bindings for the task inputs. You must handle constraints with validation in the form.\nYou can use a contract input value in operations and connectors out (on finish).
