contractSectionDescription=Define a contract for this step or pool instantiation.
processContractSectionDescription=A contract defines the information that a process requires for instantiation.\nAfter you have defined the contract, you can generate the form by clicking the UI designer icon on the right of this panel. This generates a form with the relevant widgets and data bindings for the process instantiation inputs. You must handle constraints with validation in the form.\nYou can use contract input values as the initial value of variables, documents and search keys or in connectors in (on enter).
stepContractSectionDescription=A contract defines the information that a task requires to execute. If inputs are missing or constraints are not fulfilled on form submission, the task is not executed and stays ready.\nAfter you have defined the contract, you can generate the form by clicking the UI designer icon on the right of this panel. This generates a form with the relevant widgets and data bindings for the task inputs. You must handle constraints with validation in the form.\nYou can use a contract input value in operations and connectors out (on finish).

contractOperationGenerationMsg=The contract inputs have been specified.\n\nOperations to set the values of the business variable attributes with the contract inputs values will be generated.They can be viewed in the Operations pane.\nIf operations have already been generated for these attributes, they will not be replaced. The new operations are added to the list.\n\nContract inputs and operations can be edited manually.\nHowever, there is no refactoring (for example, updating the attribute name or a multiple property in a business object or contract element will break the operation).

contractStrictGenerationMsg=The contract inputs have been specified.\nA script that sets the default values of the business variable attributes with the contract input values will be generated. It can be viewed and edited in the Data tab. If the default value of a business variable already exists, this script will override it.\n\nContract inputs and the script can be edited manually.\nHowever, there is no refactoring (for example, updating the attribute name or a multiple property in a business object or contract element will break the script).
invalidBusinessDataSelected=Invalid business data selected.
