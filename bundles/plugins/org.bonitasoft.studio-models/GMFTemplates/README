GMF is using XPand templates for code generation. Original templates are located in a template directory inside org.eclipse.gmf.codegen plug-in. To customize generated code user can copy necessary template file(s) from this plug-in into the folder specified as Template Directory and change template(s) content. Modified template(s) will be used on next code generation; a project named .JETEmitter is generated in your workspace to hold the Java sources and classes generated from the templates. Keep in mind that the templates use instructions that are only available in Java 5.0 and later versions. If your default workspace setting for the Java compiler compliance level isn't set to 5.0, you'll have to adjust the project specific setting to 5.0, otherwise the code generation will abort.
