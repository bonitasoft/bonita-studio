applicationDetails=Application descriptors hold meta data about the application (url token, name, version, user profile), but also its navigation,\nas well as links to the pages it needs to access.\nThey were created in the Portal prior to Bonita 7.5 and are now handled in the Studio to ease packaging and deployment.\nThe Studio is not aware of what is created in the Portal, so deploying an application descriptor may overwrite some Portal content.
