applicationInfo=An application file contains one or several application descriptors.\nSince each application is dedicated to a unique user profile, you can use this file to bundle together applications on the same topic.\n\nExample:\nManaging leave requests with Bonita BPM can be handled with such a file, containing one application descriptor for employees,\none for managers, one for HR officers, and one for administrators
applicationDetails=Application descriptors hold meta data about the application (url token, name, version, user profile), but also its navigation,\nas well as links to the pages it needs to access.\nThey were created in the Portal prior to Bonita BPM 7.5 and are now handled in the Studio to ease packaging and deployment.\nThe Studio is not aware of what is created in the Portal, so deploying an application descriptor may overwrite some Portal content.
